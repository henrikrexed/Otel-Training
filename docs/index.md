## 🎯 What is This Hackathon?

[Hackathon Kickoff: What You’ll Build & What to Expect](https://youtu.be/CPC8uhKKFCU)

The **Vegas Casino Observability Hackathon** is a hands-on learning experience where you'll:

- **Learn GitHub Copilot**: Master AI-assisted development with GitHub Copilot
- **Improve Observability**: Enhance OpenTelemetry instrumentation using Copilot
- **Work with Dynatrace**: Query data, create dashboards, and build custom apps
- **Practice Real-World Skills**: Work with microservices, Kubernetes, and feature flags

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- ✅ A GitHub account
- ✅ Access to GitHub Copilot (included with GitHub subscription)
- ✅ Ability to fork this repository
- ✅ An email address for Dynatrace tenant access

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Fork [this repository](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/Perform-Hackathon-2026) to your GitHub account

2. **Start the Hackathon**
   - Visit the [Hackathon Challenges](overview/hackathon-index.md) page
   - Begin with GitHub Copilot Challenge 01
   - Complete challenges in order, then move to Dynatrace challenges

## 📋 Challenge Overview

See the [Hackathon Challenges](overview/hackathon-index.md) page for a complete overview of all challenges organized by track.

## 🏗️ The Vegas Casino Application

The hackathon uses a **microservices-based casino application** with:

- **4 Game Services**: Slots (Node.js), Roulette (Python), Dice (Go), Blackjack (Node.js)
- **Frontend Service**: Web UI for players
- **Scoring Service**: Leaderboards and statistics (Java/Spring Boot)
- **Dashboard Service**: Analytics and reporting
- **Supporting Infrastructure**: Redis, PostgreSQL, OpenTelemetry Collector

All services are pre-instrumented with OpenTelemetry and deployed in a Kubernetes cluster running in your DevContainer.

## 🔄 Development Workflow

!!! important "Important: Building Images"

    **You don't build images locally!** All Docker images are built automatically via GitHub Actions when you:
    
    1. Make code changes in your forked repository
    2. Commit and push your changes
    3. GitHub Actions automatically builds new Docker images
    4. Update your Helm deployment to use the new images

See the [Development Guide](development/source-code.md) for details on:
- Where source code is located
- How GitHub Actions builds images
- How to update your deployment with Helm
